      <h1 id="me">HOW IS IT DEVELOPED BY EMPLOYEES?</h1>
      <p id="text">( part performed by me as an intern )</p>

      <h2>Day after day, the constant commitment of our employees translates into an activity that goes beyond the development of software improvements,
        clearly visible in our periodic updates. They devote a considerable amount of time and resources to education and refinement
        of our internal artificial intelligence network. This process involves a meticulous selection operation by the employees,
        who carefully examine thousands of images for characteristics such as color, conformity and content. This rich pool of images comes next
        transmitted to the neural network, providing a substrate of data from which to draw in order to learn and improve. It is through this collaboration between
        human attention to detail and the power of artificial intelligence that our neural network is constantly learning and honing its ability to
        discern, gradually approaching the error threshold towards an increasingly insignificant deviation from the point of perfection, i.e. zero.
