  <h2>Our custom designed camera for the freeways. This advanced device was developed to deliver exceptional accuracy
    in the acquisition of data, including models, colors, license plates and types of vehicles, even at variable speeds. However, its distinguishing feature
    it goes beyond the ability to detect fundamental details. This remarkable device is designed for the demanding freeway environment, where precision
    and reliability are key. The camera is
    capable of accurately capturing key information even in conditions of heavy traffic and high-speed vehicular flows. This ability to
    adaptation is a crucial element in ensuring the safety and effective management of modern expressways.
    But the real revolution lies in its main feature: wireless connectivity. In addition to being able to be connected via traditional wiring, the
    our camera is able to establish a reliable wireless connection. This aspect allows for an easier and more versatile installation, reducing the
    time and costs associated with wiring. In addition, this wireless connectivity allows information to be obtained virtually instantaneously, enabling a response
    fast and effective to situations in real time. We understand that installation and connectivity are key elements in road surveillance.
    That's why we have special place
    attention to these aspects, designing a camera that offers unprecedented flexibility. Wireless connectivity not only simplifies installation,
    but also the long-term management and maintenance of the device. <br><br><br> </h2>

  <div class="img" id="i2"><img src="https://www.vigilatevision.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vCounterManager.png"></div>
  <h2>An advanced device, which combines the efficiency of the latest generation cameras with an intelligent processing engine, known as the "v-engine".
    This system represents a leap forward in the field of security, adaptable to both small-sized buildings and highly complex structures.
    In addition to the monitoring power, the system stands out for its advanced analysis capacity, characterized by the recognition of three-dimensional shapes and objects.
    The versatility of this system is truly remarkable. Whether it's small buildings or larger structures, the apparatus is capable of
    perfectly adapt to different needs. The cameras within the system not only capture details precisely, but the heart of this technology,
    the "v-engine", allows you to manage and synchronize the information detected. This intelligent processing is critical to creating smooth surveillance
    and integrated. A key strength is the three-dimensional recognition capability, a feature that goes far beyond simple image recognition.
    This system can identify 3D objects and shapes, such as people, and track their movements. This feature is of particular relevance
    in environments that require close monitoring, such as commercial complexes or public buildings. The adaptability of the apparatus is further enhanced by its
    ability to be installed both on the ceiling and on the wall. This aspect is crucial to ensure that the system can be positioned optimally,
    ensuring a full field of vision and no blind spots. Furthermore, the careful design allows it to integrate discreetly and harmoniously with the aesthetics
    of the environments. <br><br><br> </h2>

  <h2>Another surveillance apparatus that leverages the potential of multiple advanced cameras, merged and orchestrated by the sophisticated processing engine, the "v-engine".
    This system represents a further step forward in ensuring uncompromising surveillance, adaptable to various situations and environments. At the heart of
    this solution are Samsung's extra business cameras, experts in dealing with the challenges of the external environment. These cameras were designed
    to withstand bad weather, precipitation and adverse elements, ensuring reliable performance in all weather conditions. This robustness
    it is essential when it comes to protecting buildings, areas and open spaces. In addition to their resistance, these cameras represent a combination of
    power and precision. Equipped with the ability to perform three-dimensional recognition, they can accurately capture and analyze details, providing insight
    more complete and comprehensive than the supervised environment. The improved resolution especially for recognizing individuals is a key element, ensuring that
    every detail is captured in a clear and defined way. The beating heart of this system is the "v-engine", which acts as a director for the cameras, managing and
    synchronizing their activities harmoniously. This processing engine is essential for system efficiency and integration, ensuring a collection
    and highly effective, non-disruptive data analysis. <br><br><br> </h2>
